  "description": [
    "This knife has remained in the Marttiini range almost continuously since the company was formed in 1928. The years have not reduced its popularity as the king of general purpose knives. This knife continues to be one of Marttiini's best selling knives.",
    "A traditional curly birch handle combined with the legendary sharp Lynx blade with the characteristic design feature of the slightly upturned blade tip. The design and decorations on the sheath also reflect our strong northern roots.",
    "An excellent general purpose knife for all outdoor activities!"
