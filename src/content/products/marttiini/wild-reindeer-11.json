    "The Marttiini Wild Reindeer 11 is a beautiful and versatile general-purpose knife that reflects the charm of northern nature. It is an iconic Marttiini blade model, developed in the ’30s by Janne Marttiini himself. The knife features a lynx blade with a blood groove and a slightly upturned tip hook, making it an excellent reliable tool for wilderness trips.",
    "The stainless-steel blade delivers durability while the shaped handle offers a firm grip. The handle is made from Finnish curly birch and reindeer antler, ensuring a good grip and making each knife unique. The reindeer antler pattern on the handle brings a touch of northern charm. The name “Pailakka” means untamed male reindeer, symbolizing its strong and durable nature. The sheath is made of leather, adding to the knife’s practicality and elegance."
