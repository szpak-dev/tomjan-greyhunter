  "description": "\nTraditionally finger guards are not part of Scandinavian knife culture, but in Central Europe for example, finger guards are commonly fitted to knives. A finger guard provides more safety for the knife user. For those who are a little less accustomed to using knives a model with a finger guard is especially justified. You can get a good grip of the knife and your hand will not slip on to the blade even in wet or cold conditions.",
