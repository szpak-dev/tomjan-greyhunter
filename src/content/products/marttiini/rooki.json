    "Rooki is a Lappish word, meaning a spotted reindeer – a rare and distinctive creature. Its unique coat pattern sets it apart from the herd, making it truly special. In the same way, the Rooki knife embodies individuality and uniqueness: its materials, shape, and patterns distinguish it from all others, creating an exceptionally rare piece of Marttiini's Unique collection.",
    "These Unique by Marttiini knives are some of the most prestigious knives we have ever made, each knife is a unique piece. These knives are designed to be elegant and beautiful collector's items. Our skilled professionals have made this knife using exclusive materials selected solely for this knife.",
    "At Marttiini, we have a long history with traditional materials from Finland, such as curly birch and reindeer antler bone. On these Unique knives, we combine these traditional materials in various ways to create a special design for each Unique knife.",
    "The Damascus blade is made by combining two different types of steel in thin layers. The blade has 120 steel layers that have been welded together under extreme pressure and heat. The result is a beautifully patterned, stainless and very hard blade (HRC 60) that stays sharp even in extended use.",
    "Every Unique by Marttiini knife is a one of a kind. They represent the beauty and toughness of the North."
