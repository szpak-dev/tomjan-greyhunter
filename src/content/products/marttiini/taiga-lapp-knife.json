    "Taiga, or the vast arctic forest zone, is a popular hiking area where a knife is handy to have. The Taiga Lapp Knife is a special knife that combines a beautiful two-tone birch handle, reflecting the diverse forest of the taiga, with a stainless chrome blade featuring an engraved taiga landscape. The knife also includes a genuine vegetable-tanned leather sheath.",
