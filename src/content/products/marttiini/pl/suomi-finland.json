  "description": [
    "The roots of the Suomi-Finland knife reach back more than 20 years. When Finland celebrated 80 years of independence in 1997, Marttiini naturally marked the occasion by crafting a special knife. In 2009, the design was refined to give it an even more distinguished appearance.",
    "At the end of the handle is the Finnish Lion, cast in metal, symbolizing the strong spirit of Finnish perseverance with which our forefathers secured the nation’s independence. The Lion is also stamped on the sheath as a proud emblem of Finnish heritage.",
    "This knife is delivered in a wooden gift box"
