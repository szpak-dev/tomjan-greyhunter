    "This sharpener is especially suitable for sharpening knives. The sharpener has two surfaces with different grit grades: first the blade is sharpened with circular movements on the rougher side, after which the blade edge is finished on the finer side by removing the circular marks.",
    "The sharpener also includes a groove for sharpening hooks. The roughened handle gives you a good grip.",
    "Use water while sharpening, then wash and dry the sharpener after use."
