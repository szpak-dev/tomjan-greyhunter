    "The handle of this traditional Lapp knife, also known as the leuku knife, combines Finnish curly birch with reindeer antler bone. The stainless chrome steel blade has a beautiful etched engraving with a Lappish theme. The leather sheath also reflects traditional Arctic patterns.",
    "This leuku knife is an excellent gift idea for all those who have lost their hearts to northern nature!"
