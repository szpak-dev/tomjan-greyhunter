  "description": [
    "The blade is made of carbon steel and is perfect for carving; it is also easy to sharpen to its original sharpness. The handle is beautifully waxed curly birch, adding elegance and durability to the knife. The sheath is a traditional Ilves sheath made from genuine vegetable-tanned leather. This knife is an excellent choice for both carving and hiking."
