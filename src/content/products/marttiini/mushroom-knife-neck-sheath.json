  "description": [
    "The Marttiini mushroom knife features a handy cleaning brush at the end of the handle for neatly removing any debris from the mushrooms. The blade is exactly the right shape and length for cutting delicate mushrooms.",
    "The sheath of this knife can be easily hung from the neck. The strap includes a safety mechanism, which opens the strap when it becomes entangled. It also includes a handy clip for attaching the knife to a jacket so that it will not be in the way when stooping to pick mushrooms."
