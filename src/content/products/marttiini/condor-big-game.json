    "This hunting and hiking knife is specifically designed for a firm grip. Its 13 cm long blade is made of matte-polished chrome steel, ensuring excellent durability. The knife is competitively priced compared to similar models, but the quality remains equally high. The rubber handle provides a secure grip even when your hands are wet."
