  "description": [
    "Cabin Chef Knife is a versatile general purpose knife. This knife is excellent for chopping and cutting vegetables and meat, as well as doing small chores at the campfire.",
    "Marttiinis knife making tradition can be seen in the small detail of the blade: the slightly upturned tip of the spine. The purpose of the upturned tip was originally to make it easier to lift a hot pot on top of an open fire.",
    "The Knife is part of the Cabin Chef set designed by Harri Koskinen.",
    "The blade of the knife is made of high-quality, durable stainless steel. The handle is made of Finnish thermally modified birch  a material known for its durability and graceful aging as well as warm and pleasant feel grip. The matte finish ensures a safe grip even when wet.",
    "The harmonious combination of beautiful design and practicality, as well as durable natural materials, guarantee that the Cabin Chef Knife is a pleasure to use, time and time again.",
    "We recommend hand wash."
