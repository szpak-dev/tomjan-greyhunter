  "description": [
    "The ideal gift for a child who wants to learn wilderness skills and how to use a knife. The Deluxe Junior is a great choice as a first knife: it’s a proper, stylish knife with a number of added safety features.",
    "The rounded tip protects against puncture wounds. The handle, made of heat-treated birch, is durable and the size is suitable for a child’s hand. The handle ensures a firm grip and the finger guard prevents fingers from slipping onto the blade.",
    "The knife blade is made of easy-care, stainless steel. Naturally, a proper knife comes with a proper leather sheath.",
    "The Deluxe Junior is a knife developed jointly by Partioaitta and Marttiini and is only available from Partioaitta and Marttiini."
