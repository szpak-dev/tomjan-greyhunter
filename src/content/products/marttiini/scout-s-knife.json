    "A knife is an essential part of every scout’s gear. The Marttiini Scout Knife has been a reliable companion for decades. The double-sided finger guard enhances user safety. The blade is made of easy-to-maintain chrome steel. The sheath with a snap closure features an embossed scout emblem, giving the knife a traditional look. This knife is an excellent general-purpose knife for young users, as it allows them to safely practice their knife-handling skills."
