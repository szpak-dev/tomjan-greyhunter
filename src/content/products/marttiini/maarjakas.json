    "Marjakaas refers to curly birch, which is a valuable wood material. Curly birch has dark streaks within the wood and is a popular material for decorative items. Each curly birch is unique in its pattern, just like this Marjakaas knife. The handle of the knife is made of beautiful heat-treated curly birch, adorned with light untreated curls, reindeer antler, and dyed birch veneer. The blade is a stunning 10 cm Damascus steel, and the black sheath is genuine leather."
