    "The Martef coating reduces friction to almost zero while protecting the blade against corrosion. Cleaning the blade after use is extremely easy.",
    "The textured rubber handle and the finger guard ensure a firm grip of the knife even in difficult conditions. This blade length is suitable for processing fish of about 2-3 kg. Many other kitchen chores, such as slicing vegetables, become easy with this knife.",
    "The filleting knife is supplied with a plastic sheath.",
    "We recommend hand wash."
