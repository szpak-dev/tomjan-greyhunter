  "description": [
    "Cabin Chef Knife is a versatile general purpose knife. This knife is excellent for chopping and cutting vegetables and meat, as well as doing small chores at the campfire.",
    "Marttiinis knife making tradition can be seen in the small detail of the blade: the slightly upturned tip of the spine. The purpose of the upturned tip was originally to make it easier to lift a hot pot on top of an open fire.",
    "The Knife is part of the Cabin Chef set designed by Harri Koskinen.",
    "The blade of the knife is made of high-quality, durable stainless steel. The handle is made of Finnish thermally modified birch a material known for its durability and graceful aging as well as warm and pleasant feel grip. The matte finish ensures a safe grip even when wet.",
    "The harmonious combination of beautiful design and practicality, as well as durable natural materials, guarantee that the Cabin Chef Knife is a pleasure to use, time and time again.",
    "We recommend hand wash."
