    "This unique knife is named after the natural white shades of snow. The knife features a 10 cm Damascus blade with a new blade pattern called Sparse Twist. The handle is made of reindeer antler and juniper wood. The sheath is made of genuine snow-white leather.",
    "These Unique by Marttiini knives are some of the most prestigious knives we have ever made, each knife is a unique piece. These knives are designed to be elegant and beautiful collector's items. Our skilled professionals have made this knife using exclusive materials selected solely for this knife.",
    "At Marttiini, we have a long history with traditional materials from Finland, such as curly birch and reindeer antler bone. On these Unique knives, we combine these traditional materials in various ways to create a special design for each Unique knife.",
    "The Damascus blade is made by combining two different types of steel in thin layers. The blade has 120 steel layers that have been welded together under extreme pressure and heat. The result is a beautifully patterned, stainless and very hard blade (HRC 60) that stays sharp even in extended use.",
