  "description": [
    "In the 1970s almost every household in Finland had the Handy knife. It was a truly general purpose knife used for peeling potatoes as well as carving wood.",
    "The shortish blade of this knife is practical for jobs that require precision. In this updated model the traditional blade design is combined with a beautiful curly birch handle. The Handy comes with a stylish leather sheath."
